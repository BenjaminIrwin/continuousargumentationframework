NOTE: In 2015, Edge presented \"A Short Course in Superforecasting\" with political and social scientist Philip Tetlock. Superforecasting is back in the news this week thanks to the UK news coverage of comments by Boris Johnson\'s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, who urged journalists to \"read Philip Tetlock\'s Superforecasters [sic], instead of political pundits who don\'t know what they\'re talking about.\")\nhttps://www.edge.org/event/a-short-course-in-superforecasting%E2%80%94philip-tetlock-an-edge-master-class\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2016.1147164\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6324/481.abstract','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1321792'),(2,'cdob63','2021-08-15 19:25:00','As a general historic principle, the embassy is sort of an abstract idea.  If the US designates the airport as the site where its ambassador is or will be conducting the diplomatic business of the United States, the \"embassy\" is probably the ambassador\'s chair in the airport lounge.  Once the ambassador and all the diplomatic staff have left the country or have stopped conducting business, there is no embassy.  Should be pretty much any minute now.  \nIf I were the GJedi (which as you have probably guessed I am not), I would go with the usual understanding of the term, and declare the embassy evacuated when no diplomatic business is being conducted in the buildings in town even if the ambassador is still signing things out at the airport.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1321684'),(2,'rjfmgy','2021-08-15 19:28:00','Yes, but in modern parlance, an embassy is considered the sovereign territory of the country represented by the embassy.

You are of course perfectly correct that the GJedi should shut this Q down under the normal-people understanding of the term as soon as the buildings are emptied of State Department functionaries. But as with the jargon in many fields of endeavour, there is both a technical and a common-sense meaning of the term, which nobody except specialists cares about, nor should they.\nIn essence:  If that\'s where the US government says the duly accredited ambassador is conducting the business of the United States, then that chair is US territory.  In this case, that would only mean that the person of the ambassador can\'t be interfered with, which is essentially the historic sense of the whole thing.  Once the ambassador leaves, if there\'s an officially designated charge d\'affaires, then the embassy is wherever that person is doing business.  Once there is no designated successor and no diplomatic business is being conducted, or once either government declares the mission defunct, then there is no embassy any more.  \nHave to sign off now; I am falling behind in my nit-picking. . . .','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1321697'),(2,'rjfmgy','2021-08-15 19:58:00','Thanks; looks like I was wrong.

I imagine the intent of the question was about the buildings, but it never hurts to ask.  \nOriginally, \"mission\" and \"embassy\" referred to the functions of the ambassador and staff, and only later attached to the land and structures, when the missions permanently acquired those bits.

You can presumably \"lose control\" of a congregation or a staff, but having to \"evacuate\" them is not an appetizing prospect.  \nThe Q does specify \"in Kabul,\" although that probably wasn\'t deliberate.

Does the U.S. do nothing, so as not to antagonize the Taliban, which already controls much of the country, and by the time they get to Kabul, will probably win the war? Or does it assist the Kabul regime with ammunition, supplies, maybe air support, in order to maintain its credibility and not abandon an ally? In the latter case, of course, it will antagonize the Taliban, and make the worst case all the more likely. If you can\'t answer, I know how you feel; I don\'t know the answer either. Nobody in Washington can answer that question, and nobody in Washington wants to have to. But I do know both options are bad, and so does everybody else.\nThe U.S. embassy in Kabul is not like just any embassy in any country. It is the proconsular headquarters of the foreign power that has installed the current regime and has kept it alive for twenty years. And in doing so, it has kept the Taliban from achieving power (or more accurately, regaining power) in Afghanistan. So the U.S. can make all the  noises it wants asking, begging, or demanding that the Taliban leave the embassy alone. And the predictable response of the Taliban will be, \"Why should we?\" The U.S. can\'t wage war for two decades and then, when it is giving up, expect that its erstwhile enemy will cut it a break. The world, warfare, and international relations just don\'t work that way. The United States is not neutral in this war, it never has been, and it can\'t plead that it is now just a bystander. To the Taliban, the United States is the enemy. In my opinion, once Washington abandons its fantasy that it can negotiate its way out of this mess, it will become obvious that it must evacuate the embassy.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1320546'),(2,'rjfmgy','2021-08-13 04:14:00','Good link.

Note that I am not saying that the worst case scenario would definitely come to pass if the embassy staff remained in place; I merely believe that it is neither prudent nor realistic to think so.

Here\'s another question: How many Afghan warlords who now support the regime are simply holding out for the best deal they can get from the Taliban? And this one: How long can the regime troops hold out in isolated cities with no logistical support? I\'m not saying they can\'t do it, but I am saying they can\'t do it forever.\nWhatever the case, the more success the Taliban has, the more it will have.

I would like to say though that I\'m not necessarily disagreeing to your points.\n- There have been previous insurgent attacks on the embassy that included machine guns, suicide vests, RPGs, etc.\n- At my lowest forecast, I was at 16% yes while the crowd was around 9% yes. This means initially I saw these events coming probabilistically relative to the crowd, but I am arguing that even though the evidence presented as of late point strongly to a YES resolution, it does not mean that it is likely. For example, if evidence fits 90% to an extremely rare event, perhaps the probability is now 1%—still not likely to happen (see Bayesian inference). There are still things that can be argued for NO resolution. One that is pending is whether or not the government, media, and/or eyewitnesses would need to confirm this.\n- Also, the US intelligence community report says it could occur. Could is ambiguous. Could could mean 10% or 50%, two different forecasts.\n- With such a crisis, there is a stronger need for embassies to help stranded citizens. On the other hand, the US Embassy\'s warning to leave the country could mean a looming evacuation pertinent to this question.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1320036'),(2,'rjfmgy','2021-08-12 15:47:00','The embassy\'s warning to U.S. citizens also made the point that the embassy may ultimately not be able to help them, so the should get out now.\n\"There have been previous insurgent attacks on the embassy that included machine guns, suicide vests, RPGs, etc.\" It seems to me that comparing hit-and-run attacks on the embassy when the U.S.-supported regime is in control of the capital to the possibility of a crisis in a Taliban-controlled capital is comparing the apples and oranges. So I didn\'t take those attacks into consideration because I consider them to be irrelevant to the question at hand.\n\"For example, if evidence fits 90% to an extremely rare event, perhaps the probability is now 1%—still not likely to happen (see Bayesian inference). \" I don\'t consider Taliban control of Afghanistan to be \"an extremely rare event;\" I consider the U.S.-supported regime to be the anomaly. The regime was installed by the U.S.; the Taliban won power on its own in the 1990s. Thus, I don\'t consider a total Taliban victory improbable.\nHere\'s what I see as the difference between your approach and mine: in my view, the administration is not going to view this as a statistical problem and formulate its policy based on a calculation of probabilities. It is going to formulate its policy by deciding what makes it look least bad, and provides the least painful solution for the administration. That is, they don\'t want a hostage crisis, they don\'t want to have to shoot their way into and out of Kabul, they don\'t want to have to fly helicopters or tiltrotor aircraft over hostile territory and possibly have to land them under fire (and lose some of them), and they don\'t want to bet all their chips on the beneficence of the Taliban.\nThey don\'t want a replay of Tehran, Saigon, Mogadishu or Benghazi. In my opinion, the odds of any of these actually happening are irrelevant. The relevant factor is, that if any of them - alone or in combination - *do* happen, the administration is going to look terrible, and the probability that the administration is sanguine about looking terrible is 0%.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1320150'),(2,'dowser','2021-08-11 23:47:00','Did you mean 0%?','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1319882'),(2,'Terry-Smith','2021-08-12 00:14:00','No, I meant 70%.

It\'s a round trip that\'s easily over 2,000 miles long, regardless of where in Afghanistan the aircraft are actually headed.\'\n\'Regardless, the realities that the 494th\'s F-15Es faced when conducting operations over Afghanistan from Al Dhafra earlier this year may, at least in part, help explain why the majority of U.S. airstrikes in the country in the past month or so appear to have been carried out by unmanned aircraft. While it\'s unclear where they have been flying from to conduct operations over Afghanistan, many drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper, have the ability to remain on station for very long periods of time with operators on the ground, likely thousands of miles away, working in shifts. \"Over the past 30 days, the U.S. military has launched about 10 airstrikes in Afghanistan, mostly with drones rather than fixed-wing aircraft,\" according to a report from Task & Purpose that was published on July 24.\nOf the sorties carried out by fixed-wing aircraft in that same time frame, it is likely that a significant number were conducted by B-52H bombers flying from the Persian Gulf region. As of May, there were six of these aircraft deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. In the past week, video and pictures have emerged online purportedly showing B-52Hs flying low enough over Kabul and Kandahar to be plainly visible, potentially with the hope of also having a deterrent effect.\'\n\'There has been discussion about U.S. military forces potentially operating from bases in neighboring countries after the completion of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which could allow aircraft to be positioned closer to the ongoing fighting. However, Pakistani officials have publicly stated that they have no intention of hosting American troops, and countries in Central Asia, so far, seem disinclined to assist, as well. Earlier this month, Russia, which has significant influence in that region, publicly warned against the deployment of U.S. military personnel to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. A more recent unconfirmed Russian media report has suggested the Kremlin might have quietly changed its position amid growing concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan.\'','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1316487'),(2,'lsgold7','2021-08-04 18:07:00','Thanks much.\nYou are correct any US planes need to overfly Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, even Kyrgyzstan.\nOnly one way to get that done quicky.\nI think Putin wants US to be able to control Al Quaeda other Islamic jihadists\nLavrov would have quick answer and even PRC died not want Taliban to be adjacent to Afghanistan.\nSo for August and September US will continue air ops in support of Kabul and Kandahar.\nBiden admin was correct to get out and ad \nDefense One indicated US air support continues part 8 31 if necessary.\nAny long term ability to target Al Quaeda in Afghanistan by drone requires Russian cooperation.\nFor now all they need is to tell their CIS allies to allow.\nThis may be happening now with Russian acquiesce ence\n@rjfmgy  is totally correct \nTime to move on from any direct military support except via Drone.\nBattle of Day 5.\nLashgar Gar center is 16 blocks \nWhat I call suburbs across highway where most people live ..are now refugees.\nThe Afghan National Army and their Special Operations Corp seem to be fighting hard all over country and I think a 15 percent chance in 6 months that Kabul will be taken which seems key fact unless Ghani shot.

This sounds great, but cities are by definition isolated, and keeping them supplied, powered, and watered requires control of their surrounding areas. So questions raised by recent events include whether the Afghan army can make good its losses (that is, of casualties plus desertions) from the populations of the cities, and does the Afghan army have the cadre to train any troops they do recruit? Will they be able to equip these troops? Will they be able to keep them supplied so they can undertake offensive operations to regain control of areas from which the Taliban can credibly threaten the cities? From news reports (which as you indicate may not be entirely accurate) so far it doesn\'t look like it.\nThat said, you\'re probably right that Kabul probably won\'t fall - or even be in danger of falling - this year.

It\'s easier for insurgents to hold small towns than big cities, and the local troops and any interested outside parties are less likely to bother trying to clear the countryside; it\'s harder to hold and stretches your forces thinner.  So except for the odd show raid and missile attack, the Taliban will tend to stay out of town for a while yet--however tight an organization it is (and thanks for raising that issue, which I had neglected).   \nI don\'t think they have to abandon an assault on the embassy to be seen as Not So Tough, @rjfmgy.

I expect the \"emergency brake\" to work.\nAnd it\'s time-limited to 30 June 2021 for the time being. Museums in Berlin in general will be closed until 05 May (?), and the situation will be reviewed then.\nHowever, I also expect the \"emergency brake\" to be extended until 30 September 2021 (probably in June), at least for the sake of having normal conditions under which the general election can be held, and there are voices in the current government (P.Altmaier, BMWi) who advocate \"no privileges\" for the vaccinated. Under these conditions, it is hard to see a sensible opening date \"to the general public\", which would be fair and not discriminate at least a group of younger citizens.\nFirst 100 days will come with no entrance fees, so it does matter when this period starts, in order to be part of it. The organizers of the exhibitions also cannot be interested in the Humboldt Forum being stormed by visitors in the last few days of such a period, just because most of them have not had an ooportunity to visit before. \nOne of the exhibitions, \"Berlin Global\" of the Berlin city museum, is planned to expire on 31 August 2021, but I guess in case of a belated opening, this exhibition will just be extended.\nBerlin will also always have an incidence rate slightly above national average from now on, and thus will be one of the states where normalcy returns last.\nThe only reason I currently see that enforces an opening rather sooner than later would be the city\'s economic senate will not want to forego a complete summer tourist season 2021, but at the same time, this sort-sighted approach has brought Germany into the situation it is in now. The ICU capacity at Charité will be crowded for a long time into the year, and thus to me the most reasonable approach would be to have an opening to the general public in September or Q4, at a time when vaccination will have been possible for everybody.\nHowever, there are currently a few job openings at the Humboldt Forum, which is a sign of ongoing planning. But most of the \"operational\" positions (security, serve staff,...) come with an indefinite start date \"until further notice\".\nThere has been so much \"muddling-through\" in the past few months (which didn\'t work well, and people are fed up with), I guess the Humboldt Forum will not want to stain their first year with more of \"muddling through\", and will chose a later date for the sake of clarity and accessiblity.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1268086'),(4,'cafebedouin','2021-04-24 11:21:00','Currently 23 million vaccinated. 83 million total population.

However, Spahn also said this will make it easier for everyday non-essential shopping and getting your hair cut, no longer having a testing requirement under a testing regime.\nWith museums in Berlin having a trial period with ticketing a certain time frame and a testing requirement, it has proven to bring along very complex logistics.\nAs the whole German response focuses on solidarity (wearing mask to protect others, prioritize the most vulnerable groups for vaccination etc.), the deal is there will be no \"double privileges\" for those already fully vaccinated. The first privilege is being vaccinated first, while others still wait and hold out due to scarce vaccines. The second privilege would be being able to return to \"normal life\" based on one\'s own vaccination ahead of all others, which is deemed a lack of solidarity.\nIf stringent, German public museums (the Humboldt Forum being one of these) would not open before every single adult has the option of being vaccinated regardless of priority group or age, and thus likely not before mid September 2021. However, there are several high-ranking constitutional law experts in Germany who state that an individual who is vaccinated can no longer justifiably be deprived of basic freedoms granted by the constitution, once it is proven that being vaccinated means one can no longer transmit the virus to others (\"sterilizing immunity\"). However, there are two caveats:\n/even though there are some recent publications that seem to indicate \"sterilizing immunity\" after vaccination exists, I don\'t believe this will have been a final proof yet, and a mutant virus such as P.1 could easily change the balance due to its properties and its ability to re-infect.\nSterilizing immunity as a precondition may never be found without a residual risk.\n/While the governments of Germany (federal) and Berlin (land/city) can no longer prohibit private economic subjects (e.g. a visitor and a privately held museum, a movie theater or similar) from agreeing on and closing a contract about a service, if the infection rate at some point in time is low enough, interventions of the administration into private citizens\' relation among themselves always need to be justified (by the goal of reducing the spread of the virus) and found adequate (being the right measure for achieving that specific goal), any public body as the owner of a museum (the Humboldt Forum\'s ownership is a publicly endowed foundation) can perfectly decide it will not open \"until the pandemic is over\" or \"until everyone is vaccinated\", just to avoid any public discussion or lawsuits against them about  discrimination.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1259725'),(4,'cafebedouin','2021-04-06 12:39:00','All you have to do is look at Bundeslinga to think your argument is probably wrong.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54229045','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1259741'),(4,'SE_Meyer','2021-04-06 12:52:00','Why?

With the 2021 German federal election nearing,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_German_federal_election\nthe federal government simply cannot afford to have a fourth, fifth and sixth wave, and thus the dominant election campaigning strategy appears to be:\n(i) impose tough measures now (just as the public opinion welcomes) and put all the necessary atrocities into the second quarter of 2021 and (ii) release the electorate from the pain just in time before the election (maybe in August) in a lot better shape and situation with only a few hundred cases per day. Experts, medical advisors and leading doctors have long advocated such an approach but sadly their voices fell on deaf ears so far. Now there\'s some sort of panic unfolding in the federal government, and a horror scenario of peaking at 100,000 cases per day and triage in hospitals and a total of 200,000 deaths (currently at 75k) is seen as the worst outcome of being too timid. The federal government is a major stakeholder in the Humboldt Forum.\nYou don\'t have to buy it, but good luck with your decision. The next info from the city of Berlin about how to proceed will likely be published today.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1260150'),(4,'cafebedouin','2021-06-14 19:07:00','@SE_Meyer: how\'s this one looking to you these days?','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1292016'),(4,'SE_Meyer','2021-06-14 19:14:00','Have they opened anything yet except from the cafe and the gift shop?

First, Japan has official costs of $15.4 billion, but government audits suggest that the actual cost of the olympics could be as much as twice as large. The IOC has agreed to give Japan $6.7 billion for costs, but even with the added revenue (sponsorship, ticket sales), Japan will still lose lots of money.  The IOC is also expected to lose lots of money as well. Revenue from broadcasting rights (which makes up about 75% of the IOC income) is expected to be about $3-4 billion. Overall, totaling all revenue and costs the IOC is expected to lose around $7 billion from these Olympic games. As such, I believe it is relatively clear that these Olympic Games are not helpful economically in the short-run.\nThat being said, as we get closer and closer to the Olympics, many of these costs are becoming sunk costs, and cancelling these olympics will result in both of these entities bearing a majority of the costs without reaping any of the revenue. \nFinally, the Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will be making the final decision, but with low approval ratings and elections this year, I think that the opinion of the Japanese public will be one of the leading factors in Suga\'s decision.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1295803'),(1,'Anneinak','2021-06-21 18:48:00','@beckersc,\nSuga may be making the decision on behalf of the host country, but it\'s the IOC which decides whether or not to cancel.

Yes, I understand Japan has a lower death per capita for Covid than the US. What does that have to do with what we are talking about? The Olympics are not being held in the united states, so what does the United States have to do with anything? \nYou could just as easily compare Japan to the Congo or to any other country in Africa. These are places where people are often lucky to get clean water let alone good healthcare, yet they only have a fraction of the covid deaths. This is likely partially because they have a lower median age but also I believe because they are frequent users of Hydroxychloroquine. Africa has about 1% the covid deaths of the US, despite only having 20% the percentage of people over 65. If it was only age, you would expect their death rate to be 20% of the United States.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+deaths&Interval=Cumulative&Relative+to+Population=true&Align+outbreaks=false&country=COG~JPN\nIf you really wanted to look at the United states, you could compare Florida to California. Florida has been open and not requiring people to wear masks for quite a while and also has one of the oldest populations in the country. They have had Disney world open and have been open for tourists for months. California has one of the youngest populations in the country and has had a very strict lockdowns.

They\'re not being hit anywhere near as hard as a country like the US where a large percentage of the population seem to think their voting habits should impact on their scientific knowledge and basic hygiene and consequently reject masks.\nReally? How good do you think data collection is in the Congo? What is the median age there?\nI don\'t think the differences within the US are as significant as you suggest, and there are plenty of factors that could explain differences between California and Florida, though I\'m not actually sure what truth you are expecting me to draw from their comparison?

It\'s not enough to account for the differences. But your point about data collection is well taken. \nThe idea that people who reject masks have a lack of scientific knowledge is pretty ridiculous. There are more than a dozen randomized control trials that find that wearing N95 masks does nothing to stop the spread of the flu. If it doesn\'t stop the flu, it\'s certainly not going to stop covid-19. To my knowledge there are zero RCTs that find that masks will stop either the flu or covid-19. \nhttps://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy\nIt\'s actually politics that have been pushing masks in the United states, and science that has been trying to tell us that masks don\'t work.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1277897'),(1,'Tolga','2021-05-16 20:19:00','I don\'t think they have been hard hit compared to somewhere like the US where mask-wearing recommendations are flouted, and I don\'t think that\'s wholly coincidental. As for the actual question in discussion, I think that\'s probably going to depend on other factors than just how much coronavirus is in Japan, it will depend on things like the risk assessed as being presented by importation of the Indian variant, for example.\nThe median age in the Congo is 17. In Japan it is 48. 2.7% of the DRC is over the age of 65, 28% of Japan is. The difference in cumulative deaths per capita is only about a factor of 10. I\'m not going to take the time to do a detailed study of it, but it seems very likely to me that the age difference explains the entire difference and then some. The DRC has probably had much more spread of covid. You mention Hydroxycholorquine and take an interest in RCTs, but you should know that use of that is not supported by evidence: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30389-8/fulltext\nOn masks: firstly I would ask why you are constraining your interest in masks to N95s, when N99s exist. But to get to your point about studies, it is very difficult to measure the reduction in transmission in terms of number of infections prevented. How would you even design such a study? (If we think most of the effect is in preventing you from infecting others). What we do know is that this virus spreads by droplets and aerosols, and that masks catch droplets and limit the turbulent airflows generating by coughing, in which aerosols and droplets are carried. They likely also have a psychological effect in that they remind people to practice social distancing, and not to touch their face (in fact they present a physical barrier to doing so).\n\"It\'s actually politics that have been pushing masks in the United states, and science that has been trying to tell us that masks don\'t work.\"\nInteresting that things are so different in the United States to the rest of the world... And perhaps it is this perception of masks as a political object that apparently leads you to reject them. \nAlso, you know that it has long since been admitted that the initial recommendations by public health officials (like Fauci, but also in other countries) not to wear masks and that they don\'t work, were lies that were (foolishly, in my opinion) concocted to protect the supply of masks for healthcare workers, right? \nDon\'t know how you guys managed to politicize a pandemic in such a way. I even see that something like half of Republicans don\'t want the vaccine, even despite Trump supporting it, having presided over Operation Warp Speed, and having been vaccinated himself.

I notice you didn\'t post any RCTs to support your position.\"\nAnd I supplied you with a perfectly good reason for why I could not supply you with such. I also note that the RCTs you reference only look at an individual\'s ability to become infected, not to spread the disease, which I and others contend is where most of the effect is.\nI\'m not sure of the meaning of \"\"Republicans\"\" here, I only reference polling that appears to show that divide in opinion along political lines. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccine-hesitancy-republican-men/\nBut I think here you may be exposing some anti-scientific credentials (ironically, after brandishing \"the science\"), by treating the vaccines with such a level of skepticism. We are well past phase 3 trials and into phase 4. All the Covid vaccines currently in use in the US have been shown to be both safe and effective against the virus as it is now in America. That may diminish over the course of the next few months as new variants emerge, but you can expect that updated vaccines will be approved in due course.\nAs for Japan, they happen to be a historically anti-vax country, unlike the US: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01937-6\nHowever, they are much more approving of Covid vaccines in 2021 than they were of vaccines generally in 2019 (and, as it happens, more approving than Republicans overall): https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/17/national/vaccine-poll-results/\nAs for whether the vaccines reduce transmission, there is certainly no doubt about this at all: they do reduce it by a significant amount. Any public health officials you might have heard contradicting this are once again telling what they believe to be a white lie because the fact of the matter is there is zero effect until 2 weeks after vaccination, and the effect builds slowly over the course of several months, in the meantime they would like us to continue with social distancing to keep the virus under control, and the best way to manage the public\'s behaviour in such a way is simply to cast doubt over the reduction in transmission. There is also the risk from the new variants, particularly the ones from Brazil, South Africa, and India, and it is very highly likely that the reduction in transmission with respect to these variants is significantly reduced (still, probably not to zero), and this is one of the reasons the vaccines are being updated.\nOut of interest, I am curious which specific problems with prior coronavirus vaccines you are referencing here?','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1278040'),(1,'erikbays','2021-05-17 16:30:00','I understand your mask argument that it is different wearing the mask to prevent transmission rather than wearing the mask to prevent receiving the disease.

If I do find the original source material I will post a link, but I have limited time to devote to that\nPhase 3 trials on the experimental vaccines are NOT complete. They are time-based and take several years. Preliminary results have been released, but don\'t let that confuse you to think that the trials are complete. They have found results that the experimental vaccines reduce symptoms. It is somewhat logical to assume that a reduction of symptoms also means a reduction in transmissibility, however, transmissibility has not yet been proven. \nIf we combine the assumption you seem to be making that masks reduce how much infected people will transmit the virus, and combine that with the assumption that a reduction of symptoms means a reduction of transmissibility, then I guess we could assume that the only people that would ever need to wear masks would be people with symptoms, and they should be isolating themselves anyway.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1278266'),(1,'erikbays','2021-05-17 16:35:00','The RCTs we have involved trained medical personnel who know how to use masks properly, and most of them involved the use of form fitting N95 masks.

One of the bigger concerns seems to be the possibility of the experimental vaccines increasing the chance of ADE. This seems to be what killed the first SARS vaccine in 2005. In animal studies this would typically happen after the animal had the vaccine for a while and was released into the population and then came into contact with the disease.  So the possibility of this particular complication may not reveal itself for some time after people have had the vaccine, and these experimental vaccines have simply not been around long enough to have the long-term testing.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/potential-for-antibodydependent-enhancement-of-sarscov2-infection-translational-implications-for-vaccine-development/504FE38E2475590EFE93872BC6D67D3D','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1278587'),(1,'Tolga','2021-05-19 13:33:00','\"I understand your mask argument that it is different wearing the mask to prevent transmission rather than wearing the mask to prevent receiving the disease. But just because it may be difficult to set up a RCT going the other direction, that just means it hasn\'t yet been proven. Your theory is still just a hypothesis.\"\nIt\'s a hypothesis with good reasons that suggest it is likely. Every decision we make in life is made on an assessment of probabilities.\n\"Phase 3 trials on the experimental vaccines are NOT complete. They are time-based and take several years. Preliminary results have been released, but don\'t let that confuse you to think that the trials are complete. They have found results that the experimental vaccines reduce symptoms. It is somewhat logical to assume that a reduction of symptoms also means a reduction in transmissibility, however, transmissibility has not yet been proven. \"\nThis is just wrong. Every individual sentence except the 4th is wrong as a matter of fact.\n\"If we combine the assumption you seem to be making that masks reduce how much infected people will transmit the virus, and combine that with the assumption that a reduction of symptoms means a reduction of transmissibility, then I guess we could assume that the only people that would ever need to wear masks would be people with symptoms, and they should be isolating themselves anyway.\"\nYes, if you assume that only symptomatics spread the virus through droplets and that people are always 100% honest about whether they are symptomatic. Which are both bad assumptions. (People are not always honest, and you emit droplets when you breathe and especially when you speak).\n\"The RCTs we have involved trained medical personnel who know how to use masks properly\"\nN95s and N99s are extremely easy to use properly, I honestly think it wouldn\'t take long to teach a chimp how to do it.\n\"I find it hard to believe these masks would not have stopped incoming droplets. To think that these trials leave the door open that masks would still be useful the other direction is a stretch to me.\" \nWell I disagree with you on both of these assessments.\nThank you for the reference with respect to SARS-1 and ADE. I was aware of this issue, but was just wondering if there was anything else. I am very satisfied that with the combination of currently prevalent variants in the US and vaccines in use that ADE is not significant, if it is even present (you would already be seeing tremendous catastrophe as a result in countries like the UK, Israel, and the US if it was significant). However, I am quite concerned that with new variants this may change... and in particular with Sinopharm and the India variant I am worried that we may possibly be seeing some signs of that in the Seychelles and Maldives, but this is extremely uncertain and a lot more will be known in a few weeks.\nHowever, if ADE does turn out to become significant in the future, it almost certainly won\'t just be in relation to vaccines, but also in relation to prior infection. Furthermore, given the lack of significant ADE with the current combination of vaccines and variants, it is likely that updated vaccines would remove that problem.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1279217'),(1,'erikbays','2021-05-19 15:42:00','https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-phase-3-trial\nThere is the link to the preliminary phase 3 results from the moderna experimental vaccine.

After all, an important part of forecasting is the assessment of sources. To be honest, I don\'t want to be in the shoes of those GJP people who have to decide how this question resolves at this point. It\'s hard to draw the line at what point you accept information as valid or not. You could insist on a certain standard of a source, e.g., a report from an international news agency such as Reuters or AP or recognition by a major regional news outlet ... or you include Twitter and local news sources as well - but then it may get difficult if there is contrasting reporting. I can\'t blame them irrespective on how they decide this question in the end. This is difficult.\nI don\'t know if it\'s appropriate to make this personal or to think that you are the most hated forecaster on the platform. If that keeps you motivated, it\'s a good thing. If not, then some introspection may lead you to a different judgment. I can only speak for myself as I\'m more of a person that tries to avoid taking things personally - at least at first - as emotion clouds judgment. That may seem weak/conformist/opportunist or whatever but it avoids adding emotion to situations in which emotion is not helpful and you may let an opportunity to learn slip.\nMy score will probably suffer in any case as I went all in with you at some point - a decision I\'ve made because I was too slow reacting to the situation in the initial companion question. Quite ironic, before I was too attached to my initial forecast, so I didn\'t change it. Now I didn\'t want to do the same mistake ... and it played out in the opposite way as I was too fast in changing my judgment. Guess the lesson I\'ve learned is that my timing needs improvement.\nBtw I don\'t know if a single question is enough to vault you onto the top of the list but it would be interesting to know for sure, i.e. the details.

We close questions with the crowd on the wrong side of maybe pretty much every month. And it has been like this since the start. I became a Superforecaster on year 1 of GJP and I can\'t remember a resolution like the one you describe, and I was a very active forecaster on the Russia-Ukraine questions (including one where the crowd was deeply on the wrong side of maybe).\nAs context for others on this thread, @Daveinsea sent multiple resolution requests while this question was open and the available evidence was conflicting, inconclusive, or both. He also sent me several emails over the last week, mostly reiterating the same arguments, which I replied to in detail. A quick count tells me I have personally read more than 46 articles on the events surrounding Tenzin\'s death. I see 48 posts by the team on the resolution of this question on our internal discussion.\nTenzin\'s death hasn\'t been in question since early September. While there were preliminary reports about this death having been caused by a shot in the neck, following reporting stated his death was caused by a landmine while he was on patrol or a reconnaissance mission at the Line of Actual Control. The patrol component comes directly from the Indian Army, per reporting, and the reconnaissance mission at the Line of Actual Control from sources attributed to the Indian Army.\nThere is reporting of yelling matches between Indian and Chinese forces on the day Tenzin died. Also, potentially, of non-lethal maneuvers without any real use of kinetic force (the main article was one which actually Dave found). Crucially, we have the Indian Army explicitly saying his death wasn\'t connected to the only known confrontation/maneuvers that day (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/died-in-landmine-blast-while-patrolling-special-frontier-forces-tibetan-commando-laid-to-rest-6587010/); a confrontation during which available coverage states both Indian and Chinese forces went out of their ways not to cause casualties, and didn\'t.\nIt is also generally indicated that the Indian Army has kept aspects surrounding Tenzin\'s death a secret, at least as it involves a special forces unit.\nTenzin\'s death occurred 2 months after the 20 deaths which closed the first version of this question, making him then the 21st death.\nSo the main thing the team is going to judge is whether the new articles Dave sent present enough evidence to make the confrontation aspect conclusive, in the context of all available evidence (the aforementioned +46 articles). I don\'t know if they will or not. I haven\'t read the new articles yet. As I have been in the weeds of this topic for months, I will ask others from the team to take the first review, trying to get fresh eyes involved. I would just like to assure everyone we take every resolution very seriously and we are as thoroughas we can, taking all presented evidence under consideration.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1192438'),(3,'LuisEnrique','2020-11-30 03:29:00','@Daveinsea let\'s keep resolutions going forward through the usual channels, especially the normal resolution requests.

In addition, Western media outlets with large circulation and good reputations are treated as having high credibility. Reports from small, local outlets will be assigned less credibility as a rule, though this will be treated on a case-by-case basis. In other cases, minor sources may be deemed credible with regard to specific issues.

Doesn\'t say much for \"mainstream\" media these days.... does it? (Or, says a lot...depending on how you look at it)\nGJO FAQ page.. Question Clarifications & Resolutions\n#3 Generally, media reports from outlets based in “free” nations (e.g., per Freedom House) are to be trusted above reports from outlets whose civil liberties and/or media freedom are contested. In addition, Western media outlets with large circulation and good reputations are treated as having high credibility. Reports from small, local outlets will be assigned less credibility as a rule, though this will be treated on a case-by-case basis. In other cases, minor sources may be deemed credible with regard to specific issues. For example, Syria’s official news agency (SANA) will not generally be considered credible, but it may suffice as a credible source for official announcements from the Syrian government.\n#2 Assessing forecasting accuracy requires questions with clear answers that can be objectively scored, but the details of many important geo-political events are difficult to anticipate. Many different scenarios and situations can produce the same result and there is a tension between how specific we are in delineating which scenarios will resolve a question and the relevance of that question. In many cases it is possible to forecast on the larger, more meaningful events, even if it is impractical to specify all the potential ways in which those events can occur. In these cases - and especially when the relevant event has significant implications - focusing only on one or two well defined scenarios risks missing important ways in which the event can unfold, making those forecasts considerably less relevant and inconsistent with what has occurred in the real world. We strive to strike a balance by asking questions that can be objectively scored without making them unnecessarily narrow. For some events, very specific questions can be asked. Other events involve more uncertainty because the ways in which the event can occur are many and varied, even if the event itself is quite clear. We believe that crowd-sourced forecasts can still be useful in predicting these important events, so the we ask some questions with less specificity. After all, the value of good judgment lies in its ability to inform good decisions in an uncertain world.\nSome forecasters will enjoy making predictions on these questions, even though they involve more uncertainty. Others will prefer to stick to the narrower questions that have more specific resolution criteria. We try to have a mix of both types of questions so that those who prefer strict falsifiability and stringent technical requirements can focus on those questions, while those that prefer the more uncertain (but often very relevant and important) questions can focus on those. The goal of GJ Open is to provide a forum where people can hone their forecasting skills while engaging on the important questions of the day: forecasting will be most rewarding if you chose the questions you are most comfortable with and whose topics are most intriguing to you.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1136107'),(3,'Grogu','2020-09-18 14:28:00','@DelapsusAngelus ONE thing I do, is that I have a list of retired Indian (and other nations) military (some in intel) that I lurk on their every word....

But a borderland battle with India is not likely to encourage a war in the China Seas. Nobody there wants to attack China. So this situation motivates China to attack India in order to have a more strategic position against India, should they need to fight them in all out war, before China invades Taiwan.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1122364'),(3,'Hammer-Time','2020-09-04 00:00:00','Not disputing your logic.

It is cheaper to take a little bit of land here and there by means like building artificial islands, diverting rivers, and laying out 5g infra. China is testing out the international community response with each of these skirmishes. \"Oh, a verbal slap on the wrist? Whatever, let\'s carry on. Occupy as long as possible until everybody forgets we stole it. Look, we still have Tibet.\" But how long will this go on? Will China will get more aggressive as time passes? From my pov, China is taking full advantage of the pandemic since every country is looking inward. With how more aggressive China has became this year, I wonder what the CCP view as its Manifest Destiny? \nI could see how you see that war may be on the horizon between China and India. I could see the possibility. Tension has been building up everywhere else between them in other realms (like boycott chinese products and the Maldives project). This might as well be a Cold War but with different parties involved. This tension could go on for years (maybe decades?) but I think right now Modi\'s supposed strategy of building strategic partnerships with other countries might be the smartest way to go (calling it strategic autonomy, Modi\'s version of Jehru\'s nonalignment) https://theprint.in/opinion/global-print/japan-jagran-manch-bcci-why-modi-china-headache-just-got-bigger/474246/). I agree with @hammer-time that India is avoiding a two front war with Pakistan as well. And I think I recall reading rumors that China is paying Nepalese to protest India and create tension in that front as well?\nI could also see the possibility of China attempting to claim Taiwan... I don\'t know how china would go about it.\nI find it interesting that from China\'s pov, it is India that is being aggressive. Just look at the headlines over at Global Times. They make it seem like they are being victimized over and over again.\nAnyway, like I said, it is a possibility that there could be a war between India and China. Probably more so than China vs countries in S China Sea. But I think a cold war between India and China persisting for years or decades is more likely than war. Whatever the case, I am surprise that little is said regarding the India-China conflict so far in the us election year.

Given that the Olympic trials have already been conducted in most countries, and that no cancellations has ever been announced this close to the games (we are now about one month away from the Olympics starting), I\'m adjusting down my estimate from the base rate.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_Games_host_cities\nhttps://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/have-olympic-games-cancelled-postponed-tokyo-2020-coronavirus-pandemic/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_Summer_Olympics\nhttps://www.nationalww2museum.org/media/press-releases/recalling-londons-lost-olympics-national-wwii-museum-highlights-history','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1302649','Upvote\n    (0)',NULL),(13,1,'augustc','2021-07-02 15:18:00',1,'Let\'s first look at the historical base rate.

There are less than 2 weeks until the given date stated of July 15, 2021, so if this announcement will come, there is not too much time left. Moreover, many of the potential reasons to cancel the Tokyo games are caused by reasons due to the COVID pandemic. There have been no cancellations of a modern Olympic games due to a pandemic in history: we can look at https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2020/pandemics-recent-history and see that while these pandemics overlapped with Olympic games, there were no cancellations then. Additionally, with COVID infections dropping significantly in Japan since May from around 6000 to 1400 a day as one can see by a simple Google search, and the setup for the Olympics in full swing (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tokyo-olympics-set-open-month-after-waves-covid-infection-opposition-n1271794, and Olympics trials for national teams in many sports already having occurred), in conjunction with the limited time horizon it seems extremely unlikely that the Olympics will be cancelled.

London has around 2,000 case per day and a population of less than 9 million and is hosting the Euro 2020 tournament with large crowds allowed as well (whereas the Olympics will have no visiting crowds, and its unclear if any crowds will be allowed). Obviously these are not perfect comparisons as the Olympics brings together people from a wide variety of countries which presents more risk, but an IOC spokesperson said that \"well above\" 80% of residents of the Olympic and Paralympic Village in Tokyo will be vaccinated as well as around 80% of the media, which seems to mitigate this risk. \nFinally, the head of Japan\'s Olympics organizing committee ruled out a few weeks ago another suspension of the games (especially driven by the massive cost delaying the games had).

While the Olympics have been canceled or postponed in the past, never before has such an announcement come so close to the commencement of the event. In fact, this is an extraordinarily rare occurrence for any mass international sporting event, and those movements/cancellations have almost always come as a response to a completely unprecedented event - typically natural disasters or similarly catastrophic events.|In this case, base-rate comparisons are likely not as important as the specifics of the situation itself, and a variety of developments across the spectrum of interested parties have clarified that it would take a situation similarly shocking to last year\'s Covid cancellation in order to force another postponement of the Olympics. The IOC generates $4bn in advertising revenue from the Olympics each cycle, which given the Summer Games\' popularity relative to the Winter Games implies Summer ad revenue of ~ $2.5bn. Given pressure from these sponsors, particularly television rightsholders like NBC, and the potential perception hit the IOC might take from a full-on cancellation given their already unsavory reputation, the IOC\'s incentives are strongly aligned in favor of holding the Games. Additionally, the IOC/Japan contract gives the IOC the ultimate authority as to whether or not the Games will go ahead, so even if Japan\'s government is against the Olympics proceeding, they\'d need to take extreme action in order to prevent them from occurring at the given start date.|The other primary stakeholder in this situation is the country of Japan, which may face the strongest incentive to postpone or cancel the Olympics given the public pressure to do so - upwards of 80%, given the country\'s relatively low vaccination rate (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/olympics/ahead-tokyo-olympics-japan-vaccination-rate-far-mark-n1272523) and the push by medical professionals and news media to more strongly consider that possibility (https://www.espn.com/radio/play/_/id/31519855). However, while the Japanese government would be the body most responsive to public opinion, there are several reasons why them doing so and not proceeding with the Games is unlikely:|1. Sunk-cost fallacy -- Japan has already spent ~ $30bn on preparations for the Games over the past decade. Not holding the Olympics would \"waste\" all this work, and although it\'s a sunk cost and shouldn\'t be taken into account, there\'s a strong emotional attachment to the Games on the part of Japan\'s government, which leads to...\n2. The Games\' purpose -- Japan won the bid to host the Olympics under the narrative that it would showcase the country\'s rebound from the earthquake/nuclear disaster of 2011, a bid led by the Japanese government. This narrative has now pivoted to a worldwide Covid recovery-oriented one as the first Olympics since the onset of the pandemic, and as a country that has handled the pandemic relatively well vs. other nations, Japan\'s leaders are invested in showing the world the strength of both their disaster and Covid recoveries.\n3. Response to public opinion -- the current Japanese government, which supports holding the Games, is up for reelection this fall. This would normally give rise to concern about the possible negative impact of ignoring public opinion with an election in the near future, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has won sound victories of > 12% in every election since 2012. This implies that even a move towards opposition parties would still leave the LDP in a strong political position, lessening their concern about possibly losing power.\n4. Preparation efforts -- this does not mean that Japan is taking no steps to respond to the concerns of their population. Stadium capacity is limited to local residents at 50% with no cheering allowed, and the typically active Olympic Village is siloed to prevent excess interaction amongst athletes and with the larger Tokyo population. There are also very strict protocols regarding the teams themselves - for example, in gymnastics, if one team member tests positive for Covid-19, every team member is no longer able to compete. While some may view such measures as excessive, it\'s an indicator that there has been a measurable response to the concerns raised by Japanese citizens.|In summation, with only two weeks until the close-out period of this question, my estimates have been revised significantly downwards to where I believe it\'s extremely unlikely it\'s announced the Games will not proceed in July 2021.','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1301316','Upvote\n    (0)',NULL),(21,1,'edward-li','2021-06-30 15:44:00',1,'The Olympics are a few weeks away, and most countries seem to be moving forward with the assumption that they will happen.

Furthermore, the organization has insisted the games will commence safely for athletes.

Japan may possibly attempt to prevent the games due to a strong majority of Japan citizens opposing the games, low vaccination rates, and uncertain Covid prevention measures. However, Japan has reportedly invested upwards of $30 billion in the games, and faces the potential of being sued by the IOC if they cancel the games as the right to host is explicitly included in the contract. This could potentially cost Japan billions of dollars. Because there is the potential nuclear option of Japan cancelling the games, I am thus assigning ~3% probability that the games are cancelled.

Another postponement is not an option by the IOC.\nThere is also significant pressure from  stakeholders for the games to proceed.\nAccording to a poll conducted in March 2021, 59% of respondents were in not in favour of holding the Games in the midst of a pandemic, 30% supporting the event. The polls seem to vary dependent on the reporting  but showing a trend to postpone/cancel.\nToshihiro Nikai,  the Secretary General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suggested that the Games could be cancelled dependent on control of the pandemic, but this was quickly backtracked by him with the Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga signalling a no- change attitude in the Government indicating perhaps a level of discussion being held as to a cancellation.\nThe British Medical Association have advised against holding the Games, given Japan’s poor record in controlling the virus.\nPressure may be relieved (at a significant loss of income) in that there will no spectators. Foreigners will almost certainly will prohibited from entering the country.\nThe participants in the Games will be subject to a regime of testing and social distancing by their home organisations and the IOC. The World Athletes President, Sebastian Coe believes the Games will proceed given the testing regimes he experienced at a half marathon test event in Sapporo this month.\nFrom the Stakeholders point of view, the official Japanese budget of $15 Billion has climbed to $26 Billion and rising. This would be written down as a loss if the games if the Games were cancelled. The IOC who are the owners of the Games are determined for the Games to proceed to protect the 73% of their income by way of broadcasting rights.\nIt is reported that Japanese companies have paid some $3 billion in sponsorship deals with International broadcasters spending significant amounts (NBC paying $1.4 billion for rights).\nThe Games are the exclusive property of the IOC and only they can terminate the contract between them and the host city of Tokyo. The IOC does have an obligation to the health of the athletes and could cancel if this was threatened (a case could be made here due to the pandemic). Should Tokyo unilaterally pull out, the organising committee would be responsible for all risks and losses.\nThere is also a symbolic significance as the Games would show a revival of Japan post Fukushima and Tsunami according to  Professor Jack Anderson at the University of Melbourne.|Given the IOC’s refusal to even consider a cancellation and the corporate finances spent, the chances of the Games proceeding are positive in that a degree of the expenditure may be recouped.|https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/05/sebastian-coe-expects-tokyo-olympics-go-ahead-after-test-event-japan-half-marathon-sapporo|https://www.dw.com/en/could-japan-cancel-tokyo-olympics-over-coronavirus/a-57223286|https://apnews.com/article/tokyo-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-tokyo-olympics-japan-olympic-games-da4ecb601dee77b963005b89631c2724|https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/05/sebastian-coe-expects-tokyo-olympics-go-ahead-after-test-event-japan-half-marathon-sapporo|https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-senior-government-figure-admits-tokyo-games-could-be-scrapped/a-57208063 \nhttps://www.ksat.com/sports/2021/04/30/are-the-tokyo-olympics-in-danger-of-being-canceled/ \nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n962 \nhttps://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/3133377/why-tokyo-thinks-2020-olympics-show-must-go-even-covid-19-booms \nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/ioc-push-ahead-with-plans-to-open-tokyo-olympics-during-state-of-emergency-121042800133_1.html \nhttps://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/article/britain-yet-decide-pfizer-offer-vaccinate-olympians/ \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57097853|https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/what-would-it-cost-to-cancel-the-tokyo-olympics/','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1278144','Upvote\n    (3)',NULL),(157,1,'schier1','2021-05-17 09:08:00',25,'It would be lose of face for Japan and the IOC to cancel again.

As of January 2021, there are more than seven contractors for each U.S. military service member remaining in Afghanistan, amounting to over 18,000 contractors according to figures from U.S. Central Command. In January 2021, then-incoming president Joe Biden\'s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. would review the peace agreement in order to effectively withdraw its remaining 2,500 soldiers from Afghanistan. Biden supported a full withdrawal in 2014 but it was initially unclear as to whether he would uphold Trump\'s May 2021 withdrawal deadline. In March 2021, news reports stated that President Biden was potentially considering keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan until November 2021. On 14 April 2021, Biden announced his intention to withdraw all regular U.S. troops by 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks and four months after the initially planned 1 May deadline. The day before the announcement, Biden called former U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama regarding his decision to withdraw. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the decision was made in order to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic. Following withdrawal, the U.S. is reportedly considering options for redeploying troops such as relocating to U.S. Navy vessels, countries in the Middle East, or Central Asian countries like Tajikistan.\'\nOn 18 February 2021, Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance has not made a decision on how to proceed regarding the withdrawal. Britain is expected to withdraw its remaining 750 Resolute Support Mission troops at the same time as the U.S. According to the plan, NATO troops would also follow the same withdrawal timeline. The U.S. indicated that some troops (the exact number had not yet been decided) will remain in the country to provide diplomatic security, and is unclear what will happen to the several hundred U.S. special operations forces working for the CIA on counter-terrorism missions. New CIA Director William Joseph Burns told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on 14 April 2021 that \"[t]here is a significant risk once the U.S. military and the coalition militaries withdraw\" but added that the U.S. would retain \"a suite of capabilities.\" The administration of President Biden intends to use a broad array of foreign police tools stretching from military occupation to total abandonment.\'\nCNBC, 08/13/21, \'Canada to send special forces to Afghanistan to close embassy in Kabul, official says\': https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/canada-to-send-special-forces-to-afghanistan-to-close-kabul-embassy.html\nBBC News, 08/13/21, \'Afghanistan: UK troops sent to get Britons out as Taliban advances\': https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58195286\nAbout 600 UK troops are to be sent to Afghanistan to assist British nationals to leave, the government has announced.\nThe Fayetteville Observer, 08/12/21, \'Fort Bragg troops to deploy to aid evacuation of Americans from U.S. embassy in Afghanistan\': https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/2021/08/12/fort-bragg-immediate-response-force-rapidly-deploys-middle-east/8114481002/\nClips from Observer article:\n\'Pentagon officials said Thursday that 3,000 troops were being sent immediately.\nAn additional infantry brigade force of about 3,500 from Fort Bragg will be flown from the United States to the Middle East to stand by in case they are needed. \nLt.

Some troops will operate counter-rocket systems known as C-RAMs, which each have Gatling guns that shoot 4,500 rounds per minute.\'\n\'Overseeing the embassy security mission is Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, a two-star Navy SEAL officer who was slated to oversee Special Operations in Afghanistan before Biden called for a withdrawal.\n“He was available. He had the experience,” Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a recent visit to Afghanistan. “I know and trust him.”\nVasely’s team will operate partly out of the old NATO military headquarters, which will belong to the embassy. Security at the compound is now provided by the State Department, McKenzie said.\nWhile Biden’s plan envisions U.S. air power being used in the post-withdrawal period only to target groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, McKenzie said any threats against the embassy or the Kabul airport could be an exception.\nIf security deteriorates rapidly, the U.S. military trains specialized forces for missions like temporarily seizing an airfield to enable evacuation flights.

From Economist:\n“ Regardless of which side fired the warning shots that sounded along the disputed India-China border on Monday night, the use of firearms marks a serious escalation. The two countries have been locked in a standoff for months. In June a gun-less brawl in which at least 20 Indian troops were killed quashed what little trust was left. Both sides began massing forces. An Indian raid last month at Chushul, supposedly to pre-empt a Chinese move, riled China by using a Tibetan-manned unit to capture territory. Over decades, agreed protocols at the border included forbidding firearms and keeping heavy weapons to a minimum. Now Ladakh is one of several fronts where the two countries are locking horns. Last week India banned 118 Chinese apps. A day later, India’s chief of defence staff hinted at starting “freedom-of-navigation operations” in Chinese-claimed waters in the South China Sea.

Likely there’s a lot of behind the scenes diplomacy we are not seeing with the goal of preventing said war.\nPrevious border disputes between China and India have typically followed a pattern of clashes followed by de-escalation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute)|Chinese official media have not made much of the incident. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_China%E2%80%93India_skirmishes). To me, this indicates that the Chinese government is not interested in pursuing further belligerence; if they were they would be rallying support from their people. There’s always the possibility of change in policy due to opaque dynamics within the party, but I believe this to be unlikely. Xi Jinping seems secure in his power and will probably not be swayed by fire-eaters.|Modi, likewise, enjoys strong approval ratings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi#Personal_life_and_image) and does not seem like he is vulnerable to being pressured into highly aggressive action.

On the whole, I think we can probably expect tensions on the border to increase rather than decrease over the next decade.|It’s possible that I have actually inverted the relationship between Modi’s political base and his freedom of maneuver. It could be that having made his reputation as a hardliner, he feels compelled to live up to it and escalates the situation.

According to the argumentation of Wang Jian, a Chinese political commentator  I follow on Youtube [3], there might be three reasons why China has decided to abandon the post in the Galwan valley:|1) A miscalculation of the Chinese intelligence and its analysts, who did not foresee the determination of India in that matter (apparently the visit of Modi to Ladakh did make an impression on China)\n2) Too many fronts open right now for the Chinese diplomacy: besides India, recently there has been a really weird nationalistic claim for Vladivostok in the Chinese internet [4] (this totally is a \"WFT, seriously?\" moment) , Xinjiang and of course Hong Kong.\n3) India threatening not to join RCEP [5] (important if we take into account the current state of the Chinese economy).|So I guess that it boils down to how strong are these (and other) reasons as an incentive to avoid further confrontation, because obviously the Chinese did not began building tents in the Galwan valley for enjoying a summer picnic in the mountains. According to Maroof Raza, a retired Indian army officer, control of the Galwan Valley and the Depsang plains (also along the LAC) could allow the construction of a road that will shorten the route to the Shaksgam valley [6], where there are lots of glaciers.

The Chinese claim they were on their own side of the Line of Actual Control when the Indian soldiers crossed over and attacked them.|While both Indian and Chinese soldiers carry weapons when they patrol the border, it has been a longstanding practice, in accordance with agreements signed by the two countries in 1996 and 2005, not to use firearms during patrol clashes. Brutal hand-to-hand fighting followed in which the Chinese killed at least 20 Indian soldiers , pushing some of the wounded over the steep cliffs overlooking the Galwan River.|- Conclusion:\nAt present, I am thinking between now and 30 Sep, both sides will aggressively build infrastructure.

For Berlin, this would mean 24 June 2021 as of now, but then again I\'m not sure these dates won\'t be subject to change this year.\nTeachers (about 1mn employees) will have to be fully vaccinated first, before school opening really is more or less safe, and vacations may this year be coordinated with lock downs, but this is rather speculative.\nIn any case and in any scenario, it\'s fairly certain that the education sector will have a higher priority than museums until immunization through the vaccination program nears herd immunity.|EDIT:\nhttps://www.3sat.de/kultur/kulturdoku/countdown-humboldt-forum-100.html','https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1260883','Upvote\n    (0)',NULL),(829,4,'SE_Meyer','2021-04-08 10:20:00',56,'Four of the stakeholders that curate spaces in the Humboldt Forum (two museums of the public foundation Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, the land Berlin (Stadtmuseum) and the Humboldt university) currently have consultations about a potential future opening date.\nhttps://www.berlin.de/ausstellungen/nachrichten/6466235-3041403-humboldt-forum-sucht-datum-fuer-echte-er.html|The Berlin senate will have consultations today on further opening, which could follow two different principles:\n/the senate could decide for Berlin separately or \n/the senate could follow a generalized federal approach which effectively means it will postpone a decision until such an approach will be defined by the federal government.\n\"Für Berlin hat Wirtschaftssenatorin Ramona Pop die Debatte eröffnet.

However, this recommendation is not based on proper research but on anecdotical evidence only that suggests that asymptomatic persons are less likely to transmit the virus if vaccinated than with a negative rapid antigen test, and this may prove to be a premature or false conclusion with regards to safety, since this kind of test on average has a false negativity rate of 42%.

It is meant to form an emsemble together with a few more reknowned, important museums on the \"Museumsinsel\" in the historic city center of Berlin: \nAltes Museum (Old Museum), Neues Museum (New Museum), Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery), Bode Museum, Pergamon Museum and finally the newly reconstruced city castle-shaped Humbolt Forum, which together as a whole \"was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites\" in 1999. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island\nThe name, by the way, refers to the Humboldt brothers, who were important advisers to the kings of Prussia in the late 18th and early 19th century and, being researchers themselves, laid the foundation of the Prussian and later German higher education system with a focus on humanism as it is known today.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt|As a museum located in Berlin (irrespective of ownership or users), disease prevention in Berlin is under the rule of the city (and land) Berlin, which currently states:\n\"Nach ersten Öffnungen Mitte des Monats lassen die Staatliche Museen in Berlin die Türen weiterer Häuser geschlossen.\nZunächst sollen die neuen Regelungen mit obligatorischen Corona-Tests in den bereits geöffneten Museen getestet werden, hieß es am Mittwoch (31. März 2021) zur Begründung. \nErste Museen bereits geöffnet\nIm ersten Schritt waren neben dem Neuen Museum mit der berühmten Nofretete die Alte Nationalgalerie, die James-Simon-Galerie, das Pergamonmuseum und das Panorama auf der Museumsinsel Berlin sowie das Museum Europäischer Kulturen in Dahlem geöffnet worden. Weitere Häuser sollten eigentlich an diesem Donnerstag folgen. Das ist nun ausgesetzt.\nGroßes Interesse an Museumsbesuchen: 30 000 Tickets in zwei Wochen verkauft\nDie bereits geöffneten Museen sollen zunächst bis zum 7. April besucht werden können. Bis dahin werde über weitere Schritte entschieden, sagte ein Sprecher der dpa in Berlin. Das Interesse ist groß. In den zwei Wochen seit Öffnung der ersten Häuser wurden den Angaben zufolge rund 30 000 Tickets verkauft.\"\nhttps://www.berlin.de/ausstellungen/nachrichten/6492485-3041403-staatliche-museen-in-berlin-verschieben-.html\nAmid the infection rates in Germany and in Berlin, the scheduled reopening after 16 March 2021 has been halted on 31 March and re-defined as a \"trial\" for visits to museums and other public spaces under strict testing regimes, which will now end on 07 April for the time being. In general, Berlin\'s \"Infektionsschutzverordnung\" (infection protection act) is due to run out on 18 April 2021, and will likely be renewed and prolonged for four more weeks in a \"Conference of decision makers\" of Bund and laender in the week before 10-17 April 2021, despite some criticism of this format and its outcomes. As a host to the federal government and with its nearly 3.5mn inhabitants, (the city and land) Berlin is of great importance and has a signalling function within the country. It is also a hotspot for international tourism and rather densely populated, so that disease control is a rather difficult task in Berlin, and rules are supposed to be rather strict in the near future.\nFrom this perspective, an opening to the general public is rather unlikely before end of May 2021. For the months of June and July 2021, a seasonal effect could suppress the virus somewhat, so that there will be a permanent pressure in the public opinion for more \"freedoms\", and museums will argue for opening to the public with their budget, the loss in revenue and the fact that alternative routes for infections, such as international travel within the EU, are still allowed.|However, being situated very close to Poland and rather close to Czechia, two countries in which the pandemic is mostly out of control due to mutant viruses, and with respect to frequent work commuting between the countries, mostly into Germany\'s eastern part due to the relatively higher wages, the pandemic and possibly future Variants of Concern (VoC) will be imported to Brandenburg (the land that surrounds Berlin) and Berlin very early and despite all testing efforts at the border. Museums and other cultural sites have a hard time to find a critical argument for why an opening now is \"necessary\", and the Humboldt Forum and e.g. the Louvre in Paris have brought up digital exhibition concepts in order to keep their relevance. In a situation, in which person-to-person contacts and mobility \"in sum\" pose a problem, in-person experience and visits of museum exhibitions are likely on the upper fringe of what the society can abstain from for a while.|There are currently nine exhibitions on schedule for \"Spring 2021\", but this schedule may only be indicative at this point and subject to changes, as the pandemic proceeds, at the moment the Humboldt Forum and all others of the \"Staatliche Museen zu Berlin\" (15 in total) will remain closed after the \"trial\" ends on 07 April for the foreseeable future and \"until further notice\".|Right next to the Humboldt Forum the memorial \"Denkmal für Freiheit und Einheit\" is now under construction, and it already missed the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall for a scheduled inauguration due to a host of delays and issues. Possible symbolic dates for an inauguration would be 03 October 2021 or 09 November 2021, if construction is to be finished by then. I can imagine that, due to a symbolic value the city castle has as well (from the balcony of the historic city castle, the first German republic, the \"Weimar republic\", and thus democracy, was proclaimed in 1918), there will be a wish by politicians, local and federal, of all parties, to release the Humboldt Forum from the pressure to open to the public soon, and to open both of the sites together and hand them to the public in one large symbolic act on one of the dates in autumn 2021. Everything else could look smallish and inappropriate amid the cost of currently 682mn EUR for the Humboldt Forum alone.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Freedom_and_Unity\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Schloss|Just yesterday 02 April 2021, the federal government announced plans which will have to be worked out in detail to establish a financial vehicle (\"Kulturfonds\") that will reimburse cultural events (and probably even venues such as museums, imho) for foregone revenues in the future, as there is much talk with respect to the variant B.1.1.7 of a \"totally new pandemic/SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-21\" even by Chancellor Angela Merkel, which is probably an acknowledgement of the fact that the impact of mutants have been widely underestimated as late as in February 2021, when steps of reopening have been decided upon very prematurely. With 2.5bn EUR probably assigned to it, the size is significant and serves as an indication that the cultural life in public spaces will not be what it used to be (and what it is expected to be) in a long long time to come.\nhttps://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/2-5-milliarden-fuer-corona-kulturfonds.265.de.html?drn:news_id=1244395|I thus start forecasting \"No.\", but will certainly adapt to new information from the Berlin administration after 07 April 2021.|EDIT: shame on me, for not checking sources first, it appears I mixed up actors and locations in the \"double proclamation of the republic\", a fancy of German history on 09 November 1918.
